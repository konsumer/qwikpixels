# qwikpixels

It's kinda like [Bloxels](http://www.bloxelsbuilder.com/)&trade; but open-source and works with readily available blocks (like Legos&trade;.)

# It's not functional yet, but keep checking back.

## development

*  We use [standard](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) for our code-standard.
*  We use npm-scripts to track all the most common tasks.

*  `npm install` - do this first. install development & code dependencies
*  `npm start` - start the qwikpixels in development mode
*  `npm run android` - start qwikpixels on an android device or emulator
*  `npm run ios` - start qwikpixels on an ios device or emulator
*  `npm test` - run unit-tests

## usage

You will need a bunch of blocks and a baseplate.

Below I made links to cheap sources for all the stuff you will need.

We need these colors:

* [White](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3003#T=S&C=1&O={"color":"1"})
* [Black](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3003#T=S&C=11&O={"color":11})
* [Red](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3003#T=S&C=5&O={"color":"5"})
* [Orange](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3003#T=S&C=4&O={"color":"4"})
* [Yellow](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3003#T=S&C=3&O={"color":"3"})
* [Lime](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3003#T=S&C=34&O={"color":"34"})
* [Medium Blue](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3003#T=S&C=42&O={"color":"42"})
* [Purple](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3003#T=S&C=24&O={"color":"24"})

I got 20 of each, but feel free to get more/less depending on your color needs. I'm working on detecting all of the basic Lego&trade; colors, so you can set it up however you want if you have different colors.

And get a [32x32 grey basemat](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3811#T=S&C=9&O={"color":9}). You can also use a [green one](http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3811#T=S&C=6&O={"color":"6"}).

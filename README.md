# qwikpixels

It's kinda like [Bloxels](http://www.bloxelsbuilder.com/)&trade; but open-source and works with readily available blocks (like Legos&trade;.)

# It's not functional yet, but keep checking back.

## development

*  We use [standard](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) for our code-standard.
*  We use npm-scripts to track all the most common tasks.

*  `npm install` - do this first. install development & code dependencies
*  `npm start` - start the qwikpixels in development mode
*  `npm run android` - start qwikpixels on an android device or emulator
*  `npm run ios` - start qwikpixels on an ios device or emulator
*  `npm test` - run unit-tests
